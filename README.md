# OptiTrip: Detecting Falls Using Optical Flow 
## Johns Hopkins University - Computer Vision Fall 2020 - Final Project 

## Executable Files
OFbased.ipynb: Implementation of optical flow based fall detection
humanPose.ipynb: Implementation of human pose only method
- currently set up to be executed locally (to change to Google Colab execution, see instructions before last cell)
combined_HP_OF: implementation of combined method
- currently setup to be executed on colab (please upload all files in this directory into the colab directory)

## Not Executable - for reference only
OF_cv2.ipynb: calculated Optical Flow method statistics across both URFD and Our Own datasets
